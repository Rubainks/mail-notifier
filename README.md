# school-mail

### Function:
Discord bot which sends a private message to you notifying when you receive a email from a specific sender.

### Background:
Back in 2020 when lockdown started, our school gave us a small vacation while they were busy figuring out the new online classes. During the break they'd often send us important emails updating us about the situation and their plans. Unfortunately I kept missing out on the emails. So I built my first ever "useful" Discord bot to notify me whenever they sent an email via DMs.

### Extra:
This is also my first ever GitHub repository. Excuse me if you notice anything dumb; I have no idea what I'm doing.
